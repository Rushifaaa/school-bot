## About the Project
Everyone knows the Assistants like "Alexa", "Google Assistant", ... They are boring.
I am trying to make an Assistant that can learn from what you say and dont repeat every sentence a thousend times.
This Assistant should also have an own Personality, but be carefull the personality depends on how you talk to him.

*Please note that I am new at this Machine Learning and AI stuff. :)<br/>


## Why "Mogwai"?
Mogwai is a name of an AI from an Anime (Strike the Blood) and means <br/>
"According to Chinese tradition, mogwai are certain demons, which often inflict harm on humans." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogwai_(Chinese_culture)), so I thought thats a good name for an Assistant, let's take that one.
